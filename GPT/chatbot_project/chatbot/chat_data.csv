what is object oriented programming,"Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data and behavior."
what are the four pillars of OOP,"The four pillars of OOP are Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism."
what is encapsulation,"Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class) to restrict direct access."
what is abstraction,"Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionalities to the user."
what is inheritance,"Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (child) derives the properties and behavior of another class (parent)."
what is polymorphism,"Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for multiple functionalities, such as method overloading and method overriding."
what is method overloading,"Method Overloading allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but different parameters."
what is method overriding,"Method Overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass."
what is constructor in oop,"A constructor is a special method in a class that initializes an object when it is created."
what is destructor in oop,"A destructor is a special method that is automatically invoked when an object is destroyed to free resources."
what is class and object,"A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class."
what is the difference between class and object,"A class is a template, whereas an object is an instance of that template containing real values."
what is multiple inheritance,"Multiple Inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one base class."
what is hybrid inheritance,"Hybrid Inheritance is a combination of multiple types of inheritance (e.g., multiple and hierarchical inheritance)."
what is an interface,"An interface is an abstract type that defines a contract for classes to implement but does not provide implementation details."
what is an abstract class,"An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes."
what is the difference between an abstract class and an interface,"An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, while an interface only has abstract methods (before Java 8)."
what is solid principle in oop,"SOLID is an acronym for five design principles: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion."
what is the difference between static and dynamic binding,"Static binding occurs at compile-time (method overloading), while dynamic binding occurs at runtime (method overriding)."
what is the difference between composition and inheritance,"Inheritance is a 'is-a' relationship where a class extends another, while composition is a 'has-a' relationship where a class contains another class."
